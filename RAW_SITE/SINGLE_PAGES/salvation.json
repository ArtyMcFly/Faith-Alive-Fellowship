Did you know that God loves you? He sent his only son, Jesus, to die for you. 
You can have a perfect, right-standing relationship with God right now! All 
your sins are forgiven by the shed blood of Jesus Christ! He paid the price we 
could not pay! He wants to have a relationship with you. Won't you receive him 
now? Pray this prayer:

\"Dear Father, I come to you in the name of Jesus. 
I believe Jesus died and rose again. Father God, I receive your forgiveness. 
I repent of my past and renounce Satan and all his works. I will serve Jesus 
Christ, as my Lord, all the days of my life. Amen\"

Romans 10:9 \"If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your 
heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.\"
