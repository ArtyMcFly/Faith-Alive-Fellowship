The information contained in this series will expose how Satan attacks believers to draw them into deception and rebellion so that a person who starts out good ends up bad; instead of bearing good fruit for God's kingdom, ends up sowing bad seeds of offense, strife, division and deception into the church world. If every believer would listen to this series and apply the principles within, there would be no dissention or church splits in the Body of Christ. This series is very revelatory, enlightening and especially prevalent in this day and age.",
