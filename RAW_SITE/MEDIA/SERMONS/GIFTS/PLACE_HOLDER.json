Priceless teaching on the gifts of the Holy Spirit such as tongues and interpretation, prophecy, gifts of healing, working of miracles, special faith, words of knowledge, words of wisdom and discerning of spirits. These messages include teaching from God's Word, stories from personal ministry experience, and the gifts of the Spirit in operation throughout the services. Great for all Christians, and especially for those called to and in the ministry!",
