Brother Tom, and you thought it was so hard and you 
thought, \"I don't know why I keep running up against 
these walls.\" But let it be known unto you so you can 
see what the power of God can plow down. So that you 
can know that the power of God is big enough to walk 
through anything that comes up against you in your path. 
It's been hard for a reason; simply because I had things 
I needed to form in you. But now that they're being formed 
in you just watch the walls fall. Watch them go down one at 
a time and watch victory walk in your path.
