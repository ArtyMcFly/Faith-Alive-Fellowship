\"For I did not call you to live as other men live. 
For I have called you to live a separated life. 
And there will be times when I shall come upon you 
by my Spirit and you shall separate yourself unto me. 
For then I will instruct you and show you things to come. 
For you have scarcely touched the Lord's garment and have 
only tasted in a small part,\" says the Lord, \"what I have 
called you to and you cannot live as other men live. 
And you shall not minister as other men minister. 
For the Lord has not called you to a conventional 
ministry, but He has called you to a supernatural ministry. 
And God will use you as a spiritual pioneer to break up 
fallow ground and to pioneer things in the Holy Ghost,\" says the Lord.
