	Prophecy in it's most basic form is a God inspired statement in a known language.
	A prophecy from God edifies, exorts and confirms the plans and 
	purposes that the Holy Ghost has put in someone's heart. The following 
	prophecies have been spoken over Pastors Tom and Stella and the local
	church at various times in their ministry.

1 Thessalonians 5:20 Amplified Bible Do not scorn or reject gifts of prophecy or prophecies [spoken revelations-words of instruction or exhortation or warning].
