			<h2 class='postTitle'>What We Believe</h2>
			<p class='postDescription limited'>We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God Equally in all parts and without error in its original manuscript, absolutely infallible, and our source of supreme revelation from God, superior to conscience and reason, though not contrary to reason; and it is therefore our infallible rule of faith and practice. (II Timothy 3:16-17; I Peter 1:23-25; Hebrews 4:12.)</p>
