I was born with lungs that were too small for my body. I always got winded easily and couldn't 
compete in heavy activities like sports. Sometimes I would have a hard time with normal breathing. 
Pastor Tom had a word about this, prayed for me, and I was totally healed. It was a miracle 
because my lungs are now normal. I thank God for every normal breath because I know He's the 
one who gave me new lungs.
