	Faith Alive Fellowship believes that everything listed here is totally and without question 
	only because of the goodness and awesomeness of our precious Heavenly Father, our Lord Jesus 
	Christ and the precious Holy Spirit. We know that no man can do miracles by himself. It is 
	only by the anointing of God, sweet manifestations of the Holy Ghost, gifts of the Spirit, 
	and the preaching and teaching of God's Word that all combines for signs and wonders.

	We want to make sure and are very careful that glory only goes to God from whom all blessings 
	flow. He can save, heal, deliver and set free if we can somehow participate in God's grace 
	flowing through us in miracle working power. How blessed and honored we are. To God be all the glory!
