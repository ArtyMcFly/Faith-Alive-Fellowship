I went up for prayer for my 5-year-old son. He had the chicken pox and I did not have a 
week of sick time I could take off from work. I asked God for a miracle of healing.

When I got home from church my son showed me how half of his chicken pox had already 
disappeared while we were at church. He only missed two days of school and grew completely 
healed quickly. Praise to the Lord Jesus!
