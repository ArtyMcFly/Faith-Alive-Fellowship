I was told by the doctors that because of some cysts in my ovaries I would need surgery to 
remove them and would not be able to have anymore children. After the operation, I still 
desired children and so did my husband. While sitting in a Holy Ghost service at Tom Terry's 
church in Reno, he was singing prophetic songs and the power of God hit me, and I woke up 
later on the floor drunk in the Spirit. To my amazement, I found out a miracle had taken 
place in my body. God replaced all that the surgery had taken! I have had several children since.
