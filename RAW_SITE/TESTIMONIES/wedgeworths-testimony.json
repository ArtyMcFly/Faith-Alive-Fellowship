We were in a service at Believer's Church in Prundale on a Sunday night. Rev. Tom Terry 
was speaking. I had lost my job and we were going to be put out of our home if we didn't 
come up with some money. I knew that God would come through for me, but I needed an answer. 
That night at the service Rev. Tom called us up and sang a prophecy over us that God was 
going to turn our captivity because we were faithful givers and would become some of the 
most prosperous people in the church. It was hard to believe by looking at all the 
circumstances, but one month later I had a new job making almost three times more than 
before. Praise Jesus!
