I was suffering with multiple sclerosis and my muscle function had deteriorated until 
I couldn't hold up my head and use my arms very well or walk very well. I went to a 
Campmeeting and heard Tom Terry speak. After the message he prayed for my husband and 
me and told me I would never be the same. I have been progressively getting better 
and my whole life has been changed and I am growing in the Lord. I thank God that 
Jesus is alive and still the Healer today!

I was healed of broken bones in my feet. I had broken them in an industrial accident and 
had been operated on. I was in a lot of pain. I even had a hard time getting up the stairs 
when the service started. Pastor Tom had a word given by the Lord that someone was in an 
accident. I came forward, obviously in pain. Pastor Tom prayed and told me to do something 
that I couldn't do before. I started jumping up and down on my feet. No pain praise God! 
I was so surprised I began to weep and cry. Jesus is Lord!

I had a bad arm frozen in place many years. Pastor Tom called me up and I was 
healed by God's power. It was a miracle from Heaven.
