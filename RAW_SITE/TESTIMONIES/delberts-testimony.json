I had had serious alcohol and drug problems for many years and my wife, my daughter, and I had ended up 
on the streets and living in the missions. My wife was sick with M.S. but Jesus has now healed her. I had 
tried to give my life to God totally but every time I did it seemed like some unknown force held me back. 
We were staying at a church and we went to their Camp meeting and my wife was healed at the Thursday 
afternoon service. The man preaching was Tom Terry and he prayed and told us Jesus was going to change our 
life. The following Tuesday we went to a bible study and Mr. Terry was there again. He prayed for me and 
I fell on the ground and was being harassed by this thing that had always caused me to not give my life 
to God. And the minister commanded the thing to come 9out and it did and I was free, praise Jesus! I 
have now given my life to God and am going to work and Jesus is healing my family.
