My daughter Sunshine had been born and had had serious seizures from the beginning. 
The doctors said it was something wrong with her brain. She stopped having these 
attacks for many years. But one day, to my horror, they returned. I called my friend 
Stella's husband Rev. Tom, and brought my daughter Sunshine over for prayer. When he 
took her in his arms, he began to weep and cry. This went on for a long time and 
Sunshine fell asleep. I took her home and she is totally well &#8212; no more seizures. Praise Jesus Christ!
