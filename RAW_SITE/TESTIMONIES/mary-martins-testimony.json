I had been severely depressed off and on all of my life. Even though I had a wonderful husband 
who loved me and I had received Jesus as my Saviour, I stsill would go through great times of 
depression. My husband said I would sit for hours and even days and just stare out the window. 
I couldn't work, cook, or do anything. One day we decided to go to visit another church than 
the one we were going to. It was a Wednesday night and the Pastor wasn't speaking. Another man, 
Brother Tom was teaching. The teaching was great and afterward I went up for prayer. When he 
laid hands on me all I remember is being helped up off the floor later. But I can remember 
something very ugly that caused that Depression all my life. I could hear cursing in my mind 
as that depression broke and began to leave. I was totally healed by Jesus' power and have 
become happy and full of joy and God is blessing me. I never am depressed anymore.
