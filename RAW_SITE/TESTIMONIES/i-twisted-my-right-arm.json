I twisted my right arm at the shoulder, and within 24 hours I could not raise my arm above my waist. 
The next morning at Sunday service, Pastor Tom laid hands on my shoulder and within a few minutes the 
Lord unlatched the catch in my arm. I could raise my arm above my head and turn my shoulder and arm any 
direction with no pain. I praise the Lord for this!
