Ever since I understood the importance of tithing and living to give, I have been blessed with 
raises and promotions. I have just skipped over a position at work to a higher paying position 
with more responsibility. It's exactly the job I asked for and I tell everyone at work it's 
because of Jesus. I thank God for the principles I have learned from Pastor Tom's teachings on 
prosperity.
