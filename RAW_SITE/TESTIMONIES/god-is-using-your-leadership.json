God is using your leadership teaching tapes mightily in Valley View Prison Camp #34, 
located high in the Mendocino National Forest / Northern California!

The Holy Ghost has been equipping the body of Christ for the effectual working of 
the ministry right here in camp 34. Many have been grounded in the Word, through your 
teaching and preaching tapes over the lasts four years. And as you have been obedient 
to shift into training leader, God has been confirming His Word by raising up prison-nationals 
into 5-fold ministry gifts, callings and leadership offices.

Here comes Joel's mighty end-time army... marching right back into the enemy's territory to 
shine the glorious light of the gospel of Jesus Christ, dispelling the darkness and setting 
the captives free in Jesus' name!

Well Shondai! God broke the mold on you Brother Tom. Just keep being you, whether 
they like it or not, because you never have been a man-pleaser, but God is pleased 
with your work and motives of the heart. Soon you will hear, 
\"Well done, good and faithful servant..\"

God's blessings in all that you and Stella put your hands to... I love you both.
