First of all, my greatest testimony is how I got my back healed after 20 years. I thought my 
work life was over and that I was going to have to depend on disability. Praise God almighty 
for healing me. I have not been to the doctor once since being healed. I also am a realtor. 
My magnificent God did my last deal. The house I sold received an offer in approximately 6 hours 
after being listed. Let me say the buyer, seller, loan officer, and I are all Christians. God 
truly watches over his children. I know if I seek God and His righteousness he will supply all 
of my needs and he will supply your needs as well. He also gave me the perfect husband 
through my prayers.

Love,<br>
May
