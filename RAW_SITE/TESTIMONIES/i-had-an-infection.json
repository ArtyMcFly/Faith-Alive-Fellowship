In the beginning of September 1991, I had an infection called Epiditimitis. I had been to the emergency 
room and they explained that the infection started in my bladder, ran to my left testicle, and into my 
left kidney. The hospital sent me to a specialist. I was in extreme pain, barely able to walk for about 
1 week. The Sunday after all this I had Pastor Tom pray over me after the service because I was embarrassed 
about it. Two days later, I was almost totally well, and three days later all the symptoms and infection 
were gone. I was completely healed, praise God!
