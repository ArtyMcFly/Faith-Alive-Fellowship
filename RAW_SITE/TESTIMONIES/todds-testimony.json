I had been having a hard time walking a good Christian life many years. I came to a Wed. night service at 
Whole Word Christian Fellowship. The Pastor called me up and told me things only God could have known and 
then he told me seven spirits had been harassing me for many years. He pointed his finger at me and 
commanded those spirits to go. Something seemed to overwhelm me and I began to scream as I fell to the floor. 
Peace like I had never known swept over me and I began to speak in other tongues. Praise God, I am delievered!
