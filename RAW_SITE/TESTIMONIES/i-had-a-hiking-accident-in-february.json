I had a hiking accident in February, which resulted in emergency skull surgery. 
Four months later, I had lost 40% of my hearing and was informed the loss would 
be progressive and permanent. Pastor Tom laid hands on me and I recovered all of 
my hearing instantly. I give Jesus all the praise for this wonderful miracle 
confirmed by the doctors.
