My eyesight was starting to deteriorate due to traumatic cataracts from a beating 
I suffered 12 years ago. I am now 31. Since prayer after a word of knowledge at 
the Whole Word Christian Fellowship prayer meeting, Jesus healed my eyes. I see 
much better now than I did a year ago. (This healing is documented in my medical file.)
