I had grown up in a Jewish home, but never been a religious Jew. I slowly began to reach out 
and search for some truth. I ended up involved in witchcraft. I found that I developed powers 
and could move objects, even exploding light bulbs just by concentrating on them.

One day, I found myself in church with a friend from work at Whole Word. At the end of the 
service, I went up to receive Jesus and was born-again and all the evil left me. No more 
witchcraft. I have been filled with the Spirit and set free.
