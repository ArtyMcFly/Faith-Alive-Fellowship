I had problems with a deteriorating disk can vertebrate in my back. I had suffered and been 
in pain for years. I had been to doctors, chiropractors and therapy. Nothing seemed to help 
much. I went to bible study with Karen Walker at Pastor Tomâ€™s apartment. He started the 
bible study and as I was sitting on the couch I was in tremendous pain. Pastor Tom prayed 
and my legs grew out and my arms grew out. He told me to bend over and I did. No pain &#8212; 
Jesus healed me instantly! Praise God!
