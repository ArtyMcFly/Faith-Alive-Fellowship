Last summer when you were ministering in Willows, CA, you asked for someone who had a 
heart problem to come up and God would heal them. I was taking medication for an 
irregular heartbeat. But, I had pressure in my chest at times. When I went up for 
prayer you said God was going to give me a new heart valve and He did because I 
don't feel any pressure at all anymore.

Thank you for your prayer and for being obedient to God. And I thank God for 
your ministry and for what He did for me.
